# AngularComponentLibrary

Welcome to my component library. I find myself needing to build a lot of these components, so I wanted to create ones that I could drop into any project and had flexible APIs for many purposes. This is open to all to use and fork as they wish, not all components have unit tests yet, but I'm working through them.

To make them as responsive as possible, I've tried to keep fonts responsive based on vw units and having the component take up 100% of whatever the width is for the wrapping div defined by the parent component.

Each component also will have a markdown readme file that has more specific documentation for their respective components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
